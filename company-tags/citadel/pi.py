# Monte Carlo simulations are a class of computational algorithms that use repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. In the context of estimating Pi (Ï€), 
# a common approach is to simulate random points inside a square and count how many fall inside a quarter circle inscribed within that square. 
# The ratio of points inside the quarter circle to the total number of points, multiplied by 4, gives an approximation of pi.
# This method is based on the principle that the area of the circle is pi*r^2 and area of square is 4*r^2.
