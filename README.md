Welcome to the **Software Engineer Interview Preparation** repository! This repository is designed to help you excel in your software engineer interviews by providing comprehensive resources for both coding and system design preparation.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to ace software engineer interviews. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to brush up on your skills or a fresh graduate preparing for your first technical interview, this repository is your one-stop destination for interview success.

## Contents

### 1. Coding Section

In the coding section, you will find a wide range of coding challenges and exercises frequently asked in software engineer interviews. These exercises are carefully curated to cover various algorithms, data structures, problem-solving techniques, and coding best practices. The solutions are provided in multiple programming languages, enabling you to practice in your preferred language.

### 2. System Design Section

The system design section focuses on enhancing your understanding of designing scalable, reliable, and efficient software systems. We provide a collection of real-world scenarios and architecture problems that interviewers often present during system design interviews. By working on these scenarios, you will sharpen your ability to think critically and design robust systems.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the respective sections (coding or system design) and explore the challenges and scenarios.
3. Each challenge or scenario is accompanied by detailed explanations, hints, and, where applicable, optimal solutions.
4. You are encouraged to attempt the problems first on your own before referring to the solutions.
5. Practice regularly and track your progress to assess your improvement **with mock interviews**: [**MockAI**](https://aceinterview.app/)
